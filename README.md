The FileHandlingUtility.java program is a simple,console-based java application designed to help users perform basic file operations: reading,writing, and modifying text files.When the program starts,it displays a menu that lets the user choose what action to perform.If the user selects to read a file, the program asks for the file path and then displays its contents line by line.If the uesr chooses to write to a file,it prompts for the file path and then accepts multiple lines of input, which it saves to the file(overwriting any existing content).For modifying a file,the program asks for the file path, the text to find, and the replacement text,then updates the file by replacing all occurrence of the target text.The program continues running in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.Internally,it uses standard Java classes like BufferedReader,BufferedWriter,FileReader and FileWriter to handle files,making it an educational example of basic file handling and user interaction in Java.
